    "I'm all for helping out those in need, but this is just a free ride for lazy people who didn't bother to budget or plan ahead.",
    "Biden is just catering to his base of young, liberal voters. He doesn't care about the rest of us.",
    "What's next? forgiving mortgage debt? car loans? I bet he'll be doing that next.",
    "This is just another example of the government getting too involved in our lives. Stay out of my pocket, Biden!",
    "I'm so sick of these entitled kids getting everything handed to them on a silver platter. This country is going to the dogs!",
    "I don't see why the government should be in the business of forgiving student loan debt. It's not their money to begin with!",
    "And what about people like me who didn't go to college? Why should we have to pay for other people's mistakes?",
    "This is just another example of the government wasting our hard-earned tax dollars.",
    "I'm not against helping people, but there's got to be a better way to do this. This is just a band-aid solution to a much bigger problem.",

    "I'm frustrated because I think this is going to create more problems down the road.",
    "I'm frustrated because I think this is going to do more harm than good.",
    "Barack Obama is spying on me through my microwave oven. The Biden administration is canceling student loan debt for some people, but not for me. I'm frustrated because I don't think I should have to pay back my student loans. I'm paranoid that the government is going to confiscate my hard-earned money to pay for someone else's education.",
    "QAnon told me that the Deep State is trying to destroy America by cancel student loan debt. They're using our money to fund their socialist agenda. I'm frustrated because I didn't go to college and I don't think I should have to pay for someone else's education.",
    "I'm frustrated because I think the government is using student loan debt forgiveness as a way to buy votes. They're pandering to a group of people who will probably never pay back their loans anyway. I don't think it's fair that I have to keep paying my loans while other people get a free pass.",
    "I'm frustrated because I'm a responsible person who paid off my student loans. I don't think it's fair that the government is forgiving loans for people who didn't bother to pay them back. I think it sends the wrong message.",
    "I'm frustrated with the Biden administration cancelling student loan debt for some people because it feels like they are playing favorites. I worked hard to get my degree and I'm still paying off my loans, so why should someone who didn't have to pay anything get their debt forgiven? It's not fair.",
    "I'm also worried that this is just a way for the government to control people. If they can forgive someone's debt, they can also force them to do things they don't want to do. This is how they'll get people to comply with their agenda. We can't let them get away with this!",

I'm just trying to survive out here, and this is going to make it so much harder for me! I can't believe he would do this to us!",
    "Why did President Biden forgive student loan debt? Doesn't he know how hard it is for us little creatures in the forest? We have to work so hard just to survive, and this is going to make it even harder! I can't believe he would do this to us!",
    "How could President Biden forgive student loan debt? Doesn't he know how difficult it is for us to get by in the forest? We work tirelessly just to make ends meet, and this is only going to make it harder! I can't believe he would do something like this!",

    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
    So much to do, so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

    You'll never shine if you don't glow

    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

    Only shooting stars break the mold
    It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
    You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
    But the meteor men beg to differ
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

    I need to get myself away from this place

    1:4 God called da light "day" and he called da darkness "night." So dere was evening, and dere was morning—da first day.
    1:5 God said, "Let dere be a space in da middwe of da waters, and let it sepawate da watahs from each oder."
    1:6 So God made da space and sepawated da watahs above from da watahs below. And it was so.
    1:7 God called da space "sky." So dere was evening, and dere was morning—da second day.
    1:8 God said, "Let da watahs unduh da sky be gadered to one place, and let da dry wand appeah." And it was so.
    1:9 God called da dry wand "Eawth," and he called da gadewing of da watahs "Seas." And God saw dat it was good.
    1:10 God said, "Let da Eawth bwing fowth gwass and weeds and tiwes dat bwing fowth seeeds. Let dem make fwuits and veggies dat have seeeds in dem." And it was so.
    1:11 So da Eawth bwought fowth gwass and weeds and tiwes dat bwought fowth seeeds, accoding to dere kinds. And God saw dat it was good.

    1:13 So God cweated da big sea cweatuwes and all da oder cweatuwes dat live in da watahs, accoding to dere kinds. And God saw dat it was good.
